          <h1><p class="my-5 "> A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs.Various educators teach rules governing the length of paragraphs. They may say that a paragraph should be 100 to 200 words long, or be no more than five or six sentences. But a good paragraph should not be measured in characters, words, or sentences</p></h1>
